  <h1 style="text-align: left; font-size: 70px;">History</h1>
  <p style=" font-size:2.35vw; float:left; width:50%; text-align: left;">Petra was established as a city by the Nabataean Arabs in the 4th century BC. The Nabataeans were a nomadic tribe that controlled trade routes in the region and Petra became an important center for trade and commerce. The city reached its peak in the 1st century AD, but it was eventually abandoned after the Roman conquest in 106 AD. The site was rediscovered in 1812 by a Swiss explorer.</p>

  <h1 style="text-align: right; font-size: 70px;">Build</h1>
  <p style=" font-size:2.35vw; float:right; width:50%;text-align: right;">Petra's buildings are built primarily of sandstone, a soft rock that can be easily carved. The Nabataeans employed a technique known as "ashlar," which involved shaping large stone blocks to fit together perfectly without the use of mortar. The city is known for its elaborate rock-cut architecture, which includes temples, tombs, and residential areas. The most famous structure at Petra is the Treasury, a temple that is carved into the rock face and is adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures.</p>
