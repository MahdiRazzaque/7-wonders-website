# 7 Wonders of the World Website

This project is a simple website showcasing the New 7 Wonders of the World. It was my first foray into web development using HTML and CSS, and serves as a testament to my foundational skills in these technologies. This project is part of my portfolio and demonstrates my early steps in web development.

## Overview

The website provides information about each of the New 7 Wonders:

* The Colosseum
* The Great Wall of China
* The Taj Mahal
* Christ the Redeemer
* Machu Picchu
* Chichén Itzá
* Petra

Each wonder has its own dedicated page with images, historical facts, construction details, and some fun trivia. The homepage displays a slideshow of the wonders and a brief introduction. There's also a feedback page for users to submit their thoughts.

## Features

* **Navigation:**  A sticky navigation bar provides easy access to all pages.
* **Slideshow:** The homepage features an automatic slideshow showcasing images of the wonders.
* **Individual Wonder Pages:**  Detailed information and images for each wonder.
* **Interactive Elements:**  Some pages incorporate interactive elements like dropdown boxes (The Colosseum) and animated text (The Great Wall, Christ the Redeemer).
* **Feedback Form:**  A user-friendly form for submitting feedback.
* **Responsive Design:**  Basic responsiveness is implemented, but further improvements could be made.
* **Popup Messages (Feedback):** Uses SweetAlert2 library for success messages on form submission.

## Setup Instructions

As this project is purely HTML and CSS (with a touch of JavaScript for interactivity), there's no complex setup required.

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `Website/0_homepage/homepage.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage Examples

* **Navigating to a Wonder's Page:** Click on the wonder's name in the navigation bar to view its dedicated page.
* **Viewing the Slideshow:** The slideshow on the homepage automatically rotates through images of the wonders. You can also manually navigate through the slideshow using the arrow buttons.
* **Interacting with Dropdown Boxes (The Colosseum):** Hover over the information buttons on The Colosseum page to reveal more details in a dropdown.
* **Submitting Feedback:** Fill out the form on the feedback page and click "Submit". A popup message will confirm successful submission.

## Future Improvements

* **Enhanced Responsiveness:**  Improve responsiveness for various screen sizes and devices.
* **More Interactive Elements:** Add more interactive features and animations to engage users.
* **Modern Design:** Update the design aesthetics to a more contemporary style.
* **Accessibility:** Enhance accessibility features for users with disabilities.
* **Server-Side Logic (Feedback):**  Implement server-side logic to actually store and process feedback data (currently, the form only displays a client-side success message).
* **More Efficient JavaScript:** Optimise and refactor JavaScript code where possible.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (minimal, primarily for interactivity and popup messages)
* SweetAlert2 (for popup messages)

## Reflections

This project was a great learning experience. While the website is simple, it helped me understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and incorporating some JavaScript. I am keen to build upon this foundation and explore more advanced web development concepts in the future.
